CrossChat
=========

Cross-platform (Android, iOS, WP8, Windows Store) chat application with server

The application is built using Domain-driven development (DDD)
Server side uses EntityFramework code first and SuperSockets as data storage and transmission. Also I tried to do TDD for application layer ;-).

Client is being developed and I am planning to use awesome MvvmCross library in order to create clients for ios, android, wp, ws and wpf.
